**Introduction:**  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools play a pivotal role in automating and managing cloud resources. The Cloud Development Kit (CDK), CloudFormation, and Serverless Framework are three popular choices for creating and managing infrastructure. Each tool has its unique approach, benefits, and trade-offs.

**Cloud Development Kit (CDK):**  
CDK is a modern IaC tool that allows developers to define cloud resources using familiar programming languages like Python, TypeScript, and Java. It abstracts away some of the complexities of infrastructure provisioning and offers a high level of reusability and composability through the use of object-oriented constructs. CDK generates CloudFormation templates under the hood, which are then deployed to the cloud provider.

*Example CDK Code (TypeScript):*
```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
      versioned: true,
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');
```

**CloudFormation:**  
CloudFormation is a native AWS service that allows you to describe and provision infrastructure using JSON or YAML templates. It's declarative and offers a wide array of resources and features, but can become verbose and less developer-friendly for complex setups.

*Example CloudFormation Template (YAML):*
```yaml
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-bucket
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
```

**Serverless Framework:**  
The Serverless Framework is designed specifically for building serverless applications. It abstracts the complexities of managing resources, event triggers, and permissions, providing a simplified way to deploy serverless functions and related resources. It supports multiple cloud providers and is often used for Lambda-based applications.

*Example Serverless Framework Configuration (YAML):*
```yaml
service: my-service
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http:
          path: hello
          method: get
```

**Comparison:**  
- **Abstraction Level:**  
  - CDK: High-level, code-driven constructs.
  - CloudFormation: Declarative, template-based.
  - Serverless Framework: Simplified, event-driven for serverless applications.

- **Ease of Use:**  
  - CDK: Familiar programming languages, great for developers.
  - CloudFormation: Can be verbose and less intuitive for complex setups.
  - Serverless Framework: Simplified for serverless use cases.

- **Reusability:**  
  - CDK: Strong reusability through object-oriented constructs.
  - CloudFormation: Limited reusability with mappings, outputs, and imports.
  - Serverless Framework: Limited reusability but supports plugin architecture.

- **Ecosystem and Support:**  
  - CDK: Growing ecosystem, well-supported by AWS.
  - CloudFormation: Native AWS service, strong support, and community.
  - Serverless Framework: Active community, supports multiple cloud providers.

- **Use Cases:**  
  - CDK: General cloud resource provisioning, complex scenarios.
  - CloudFormation: Broad range of infrastructure provisioning.
  - Serverless Framework: Focused on serverless applications.

In summary, CDK offers a developer-friendly approach, CloudFormation provides a comprehensive set of resources, and Serverless Framework specializes in serverless applications. The choice depends on your familiarity with programming languages, the complexity of your infrastructure, and your specific use case.
